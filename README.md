# SAND optimization of fluid viscous dampers (FVDs)  

Python code for size and placement of fluid viscous dampers with a simultaneous analysis and design (SAND) optimization approach.   

Code for reproducing the numerical results of the first example discussed in:   
> Pollini N. (2023). On simultaneous analysis and design optimization for seismic retrofitting with fluid viscous dampers. Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization. 

To run the code execute `Main_SAND_2D.py`. The results are saved in the folder `continuous_sol`.

The code to run needs the Gurobi Optimization solver. You can obtain a free academic license. To obtain Gurobi visit: https://www.gurobi.com/.
